                    Although <b>memory</b> commonly refers to <u>the storage and retrieval of information</u>, there is no absolute boundary between 
                    the processes of learning and those of memory. <b>Learning and memory</b> are best viewed as occurring along a continuum of 
                    time that also includes processes like <u>attention, sensation, and perception</u>. Among the critical steps along the pathway 
                    of memory processing are <u>encoding, consolidation, and retrieval</u>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Encoding</b> refers to the transformation of input into a form 
                    the brain can process further. <b>Consolidation</b> refers to the organization of memory information into more long-term storage. 
                    <b>Retrieval</b>, of course, is the recovery of the stored information. Some cognitive neuroscientists add an additional phase called 
                    reconsolidation. As we use memories, they are vulnerable to modification, and reconsolidation refers to the stabilizing of the 
                    used memory.

                                <p> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson%E2%80%93Shiffrin_memory_model" target="_blank"><b>the Atkinson-Shiffrin model</b></a>, any information sensed by an organism initially enters the <b>sensory memory</b>. 
                                From this initial set of data, we select information for further processing and move it to the next stage of memory, the <b>short-term memory</b>. 
                                This stage contains all the data about which we are currently thinking. In an adaptation of the concept of short-term memory, 
                                information is sorted within a working memory into temporary storage areas or buffers for auditory, visual, 
                                or combined types of information, managed by a “central executive” process <sub>(Baddeley, 2000; Baddeley & Hitch, 1974)</sub>.

                                <p>
                                The final destination for information in the Atkinson-Shiffrin model is <b>long-term memory</b>. Unlike short-term memory, 
                                long-term memory seems to have few, if any, limitations on capacity or duration. Elderly people still recall childhood
                                memories of events that occurred many years in the past and retain the ability to learn and remember facts read in the 
                                morning news, in spite of the large quantity of information already stored from a lifetime of experience.

                        Significant evidence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe" target="_blank"><b>temporal lobe</b></a>’s involvement in memory came from case studies of patients with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia" target="_blank"><b>anterograde amnesia</b></a>. 
                        Patients suffering from anterograde amnesia appear to retain their newly acquired procedural, implicit memories while experiencing 
                        a dramatic deficit in their ability to form new explicit memories. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the most thoroughly studied cases of anterograde amnesia 
                        is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Molaison" target="_blank"><b>Henry Molaison</b></a> (1926–2008), known in the literature as the amnesic 
                        patient H. M. Possibly as a result of a childhood bicycle accident in which he suffered brain damage, 
                        Molaison experienced severe seizures that required surgery when he was 27. The <u>hippocampus, amygdala, 
                        and part of the association cortex of the temporal lobe</u> were removed from both his right and left 
                        hemipheres <sub>(Corkin, Amaral, Gonzalez, Johnson, & Hyman, 1997)</sub>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He remembered most of the information he had acquired prior to surgery, but his anterograde amnesia was profound. 
                        He seemed completely <b>unable</b> to transfer any new information about people, places, events, and numbers from short-term 
                        memory to long-term memory.

                            The application of a rapid series of electrical shocks to one of these pathways increases the postsynaptic 
                            potentials recorded in their target hippocampal cells. In other words, experience makes these synapses more 
                            efficient. The change in responsiveness in the target cells after the rapid series of shocks is known 
                            as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation" target="_blank"><b>long-term potentiation</b></a>, or LTP. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Several factors point to LTP as an important memory device. 
                            First, the fact that LTP <u>lasts a long time</u> is important because we believe that some memories last throughout life. 
                            Second, it takes <u>only seconds of input</u> to produce LTP. In many cases, we are able to remember very brief exposures to stimuli.
